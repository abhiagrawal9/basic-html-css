        <strong>Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee
        beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe,
        coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds
        (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on
        the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with
        near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
